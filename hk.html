              <h4>Oil Refinery</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>We select the optimum location, construction, design and "go-live" of an oil refinery with a volume of up to thousands of barrels crude per day together with Nelson coefficient for up to 10 and above with a multipurpose approach for both raw and finished products.</li>
                <li>We provide the most effective and efficient technological solutions for processing of secondary products.</li>
                <li>We ensure to finish and implement the intensive petrochemical process with an emphasis on polymers and oxygen-containing products.</li>
                <li>The project will be implemented with investment financing estimation about a billion dollars in total and on the principles of public-private partnership.

              <h4>Electricity Generation</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>The main principle of this proposal is to renew by the replacement of generating capacity which is apparently the same but in modern hardware and technological solutions that increases the efficiency and improves environmental friendliness, installed capacity factor rising and reducing the cost of electricity produced.</li>
                <li>In accordance with the results of a comprehensive technical, industrial, and marketing audit and ranking of scenarios of electricity demand, the replacement of generating capacity can be made with a change in generation technology; example: “diesel to coal”.</li>
                <li>In cases of forced satisfaction of peak demand with basic generation technologies, the projects will be widened for the capacity for the accumulation or distribution of electricity.</li>
                <li>The first phase of the project has a framework for substitution under a concession scheme of 5 gas power plants with a total installed capacity of 3.2 GW with an estimated investment capital, involving local sub-partners, of up to $[1.9] billion.</li>

              <h4>Regasification Terminal</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Our objective for the Regasification terminal project is to construct a modern regasification terminal with a capacity of billion cubic meters of Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) per annum of the first stage with an estimated investment amounting to $[1.2] billion.</li>
                <li>The choice between conventional, offshore, floating modifications of the terminal or in conjunction of which, will be followed through within the framework of the appearance design based on the conjuncture and technological analysis according to the technological maturity, evaluated by Request for Proposal (RFP) method.</li>
                <li>At the initial stage of the project, a set of variant analysis for the infrastructure and complementary solutions of the terminal will be carried out.</li>
                <li>Therefore, Decisions on network infrastructure and gas compression facilities will be made and implemented.</li>
                <li>We will implement the project by the concept of 'build-own-operate. Which will allow the terminal to be used as both internal technological redistribution in liquified gas import own operations, and for the provision of external commercial services.</li>

              <h4>Fuel Supply</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>We guaranteed fuel supply based on guaranteed annual crude supply by Rosneft on Atlantic and Pacific regions amounting to 20-25 million tons.</li>
                <li>Our project core is the production of both technological fuels for electricity production infrastructure and consumer fuels for wholesale and retail markets.</li>
                <li>Production will be the edge to widen the scope for certification and supply of modern compounding motor fuels. The use of which is better ecologically, justified technologically, and cheaper economically- like methanol-mixed, clavulanic acid, etc. </li>
                <li>Processing & supply business scheme with €10 billion finance deposit will mitigate most hydrocarbon country market risks by stockpiling and peaks covering.</li>
                <li>As above-mentioned, the essentiality of this project is to serve as a source of initial funding and financial consistency provider for all projects of the program.</li>

              <h4>Gas Motor Fuel</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Gas Motor Fuel proposal involves the development and implementation of a portfolio of local gas engine projects all over the Philippines, inclusive of compression nodes, a logistic network, transportation facilities, wholesale bases, equipment centers, as well as specialized and retail Compressed natural gas (CNG) and Liquified petroleum gas (LPG) filling stations, including hybrid ones-for traditional and gas motor fuels.</li>
                <li>The marketing strategy of the project is to gradually expand the goal of customer segments, which will begin with municipal transport, and then through commercial vehicles up until to private autos.</li>
                <li>In cooperation of a large number of local stakeholders, and by using the full range of modern investment financing formats- equity, debt and mixed. This project will be developed and implemented suchlike abovementioned.</li>
